Privileges are objects the possesion of which allows code to bypass
certain label protections.  An instance of class 'PrivDesc' describes
a pre-order among labels in which certain unequal labels become
equivalent.  A 'Priv' object containing a 'PrivDesc' instance allows
code to make those unequal labels equivalent for the purposes of many
library functions.  Effectively a 'PrivDesc' instance /describes/
privileges, while a 'Priv' object /embodies/ them.  Any code is free
to construct arbitrarily powerful 'PrivDesc' values.  Security is
enforced by preventing safe code from accessing the constructor for
'Priv' (called 'PrivTCB').

Put another way, privileges allow you to behave as if @L_1
``canFlowTo`` L_2@ even when that is not the case, but only for
certain pairs of labels @L_1@ and @L_2@; which pairs depends on the
specific privileges.  The process of allowing data labeled @L_1@ to
infulence data labeled @L_2@ when @(L_1 ``canFlowTo`` L_2) == False@
is known as /downgrading/.

The central function in this module is 'canFlowToP', which performs a
more permissive can-flow-to check by exercising particular privileges
(in literature this relation is commonly written @&#8849;&#8346;@ for
privileges @p@).  Most core 'LIO' function have variants ending @...P@
that take a privilege argument to act in a more permissive way.
'canFlowToP' is defined in terms of the method 'canFlowToPrivDesc',
which performs the same check on a 'PrivDesc' instance.

By convention, all 'PrivDesc' instances should also be instances of
'Monoid', allowing privileges to be combined with 'mappend'.

{- $gateIntro

LIO provides a basic implementation of /gates/, useful in providing
controlled RPC-like services where the client and service provider are
in mutual distrust. 

A service provider uses 'gate' to create a gate data type @'Gate' d a@
given a computation of type @d -> a@. Here, @d@ is a privilege
description (type variable for an instance of 'PrivDesc').  Gates are
invoked with 'callGate', and as such the service provider has the
guarantee that the client (the caller) owns the privileges
corresponding to the privilege description @d@.  In effect, this
allows a client to \"prove\" to the service provider that they own
certain privileges without entrusting the service with its privileges.
The gate computation can analyze this privilege description before
performing the \"actual\" computation.  The client and server solely
need to trust the implementation of 'callGate'.

-- | A Gate is a lambda abstraction from a privilege description to an
-- arbitrary type @a@. Applying the gate is accomplished with 'callGate'
-- which takes a privilege argument that is converted to a description
-- before invoking the gate computation.
newtype Gate d a = GateTCB (d -> a) deriving Typeable
-- Note GateTCB is trusted by convention.  Anyone with access to the
-- symbol can call any gate while claiming arbitrary privileges.  In
-- the absence of gates, however, GateTCB doesn't provide any
-- particular privileges.

-- | Create a gate given a computation from a privilege description.
-- Note that because of currying type 'a' may itself be a function

-- | Given a gate and privilege, execute the gate computation.  It is

-- Note that, in general, code should /not/ provide privileges to
-- functions other than @callGate@ when wishing to call a gate. This
-- function is provided by LIO since it can be easily inspected by
-- both the gate creator and caller to be doing the \"right\" thing:

{- $gateExample

This example uses "LIO.DCLabel" to demonstrate the use of gates.  The
service provider provides @addGate@ which adds two integers if the
gate is called by a piece of code that owns the \"Alice\" or \"Bob\"
principals. Otherwise, it simply returns @Nothing@.
