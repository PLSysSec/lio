Synopsis:       Labeled IO Information Flow Control Library
Category:       Security
Description:
  The /Labeled IO/ (LIO) library is an information flow control (IFC)
  library. IFC is a mechanism that enforces security policies by
  tracking and controlling the flow of information within a system.
  Different from discretionary access control (think UNIX file
  permissions), with IFC you can execute an untrusted computation on
  your secret data and be sure that it does not leak it or overwrite
  it.

  .
  LIO is an IFC library that can be used to implement such untrusted
  computations. LIO provides combinators similar to those of 'IO' for
  performing side-effecting computations (e.g., accessing the
  filesystem, modifying mutable references, throwing exceptions, etc.)
  To track and control the flow of information, LIO associates a
  security policy, usually called a /label/, with every piece of data.
  A label may, for example, impose a restriction on who can observe,
  propagate, or modify the data labeled as such.  Different from
  standard IO operations, the LIO counterparts usually take an
  additional parameter for the label which they inspect before
  actually performing the (underlying IO) side-effecting computation.
  So, before writing to a file LIO asserts that the write will not
  violate any security policies associated with the file or the data
  to be written.

  .

  Most code should import module "LIO" and whichever label format the
  application is using (e.g., "LIO.DCLabel"). All untrusted code
  should have type 'LIO', which trusted code can safely execute with
  'evalLIO'. See "LIO" for a description of the core library API.

  .

  The paper that describes the core of LIO, including motivation and
  formal modeling/proofs, is available here:
