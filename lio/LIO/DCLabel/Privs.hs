Privileges allow a piece of code to bypass certain information flow
restrictions imposed by labels.  A privilege is simply a conjunction
of disjunctions of 'Principal's, i.e., a 'Component'. We say that a
piece of code containing a singleton 'Clause' owns the 'Principal'
composing the 'Clause'.  However, we allow for the more general notion
of ownership of a clause, or category, as to create a
privilege-hierarchy. Specifically, a piece of code exercising a
privilege @P@ can always exercise privilege @P'@ (instead), if @P' => P@.
(This is similar to the DLM notion of \"can act for\".) Hence, if a
piece of code with certain privileges implies a clause, then it is
said to own the clause. Consequently it can bypass the restrictions of
the clause in any label.

Note that the privileges form a partial order over logicla implication
(@=>@), such that @'allPrivTCB' => P@ and @P => 'noPriv'@ for any
privilege @P@.  Hence, a privilege hierarchy which can be concretely
built through delegation, with 'allPrivTCB' corresponding to the
/root/, or all, privileges from which all others may be created. More
specifically, given a privilege @P'@ of type 'DCPriv', and a privilege
description @P@ of type 'DCPrivDesc', any piece of code can use
'delegatePriv' to \"mint\" @P@, assuming @P' => P@.
