This module implements Disjunction Category Labels (DCLabels).
DCLabels is a label format for information flow control (IFC) systems.
This library exports relevant data types and operations that may be
used by dynamic IFC systems such as the "LIO" library.

A 'DCLabel' is a pair of /secrecy/ and /integrity/ 'Component's
(sometimes called category sets).  Each 'Component' (or formula) is a
conjunction (implemented in terms of 'Set's) of 'Clause's (or
category) in propositional logic (without negation) specifying a
restriction on the flow of information labeled as such. Alternatively,
a 'Component' can take on the value 'DCFalse' corresponding to
falsehood.  Each 'Clause', in turn, is a disjunction of 'Principal's,
, where a 'Principal' is a source of authority of type 'ByteString',
whose meaning is application-specific (e.g., a 'Principal' can be a
user name, a URL, etc.).

A clause imposes an information flow restriction. In the case of
secrecy, a clause restricts who can read, receive, or propagate the
information, while in the case of integrity it restricts who can
modify a piece of data. The principals composing a clause are said to
/own/ the clause or category.

For information to flow from a source labeled @L_1@ to a sink @L_2@, the
restrictions imposed by the clauses of @L_2@ must at least as restrictive as
all the restrictions imposed by the clauses of @L_1@ (hence the conjunction)
in the case of secrecy, and at least as permissive in the case of integrity.
More specifically, for information to flow from @L_1@ to @L_2@, the labels
must satisfy the \"can-flow-to\" relation: @L_1 &#8849; L_2@.  The &#8849;
label check is implemented by the 'canFlowTo' function.  For labels
@L_1=\<S_1, I_1\>@, @L_2=\<S_2, I_2\>@ the can-flow-to relation is satisfied
if the secrecy component @S_2@ /implies/ @S_1@ and @I_1@ /implies/ @I_2@
(recall that a category set is a conjunction of disjunctions of principals).
For example, @\<P_1 &#8897; P_2, True\> &#8849; \<P_1, True\>@ because data
that can be read by @P_1@ is more restricting than that readable by @P_1@
or @P_2@. Conversely, @\<True,P_1\> &#8849; \<True,P_1 &#8897; P_2\>@
because data vouched for by @P_1@ or @P_2@ is more permissive than just @P_1@
(note the same principle holds when writing to sinks with such labeling).

{- $component
   A 'Component' is a conjunction of disjunctions of 'Principal's. A
   'DCLabel' is simply a pair of such 'Component's. Hence, we define
   almost all operations in terms of this construct, from which the
   'DCLabel' implementation follows almost trivially.
