Privileges are instances of the class called 'Priv'. They represent
the ability to bypass the protection of certain labels.  Specifically,
privilege allows you to behave as if @L_1 ``canFlowTo`` L_2@ even when
that is not the case.  The process of making data labeled @L_1@ affect
data labeled @L_2@ when @not (L_1 ``canFlowTo`` L_2)@ is called
/downgrading/.

The basic method of the 'Priv' class is 'canFlowToP', which performs a
more permissive can-flow-to check by exercising particular privileges
(in literature this relation is a pre-order, commonly written as
&#8849;&#8346;).  Almost all 'LIO' operations have variants ending
@...P@ that take a privilege argument to act in a more permissive way. 

All 'Priv' types are 'Monoid's, and so privileges can be combined with
'mappend'.  The creation of 'Priv' values is specific to the
particular label type in use;  the method used is 'mintTCB', but the
arguments depend on the particular label type.
