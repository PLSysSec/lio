A data type 'Labeled' protects access to pure values (hence, we refer
to values of type @'Label' a@ as /labeled values/).  The role of
labeled values is to allow users to associate heterogeneous labels (see
"LIO.Label") with values. Although LIO\'s current label protects all
values in scope with the current label, 'Labeled' values allow for
more fine grained protection. Moreover, trusted code may easily
inspect 'Labeled' values, for instance, when inserting values into a
database.

Without the appropriate privileges, one cannot produce a pure
/unlabeled/ value that depends on a secret 'Labeled' value, or
conversely produce a high-integrity 'Labeled' value based on pure
data.  This module exports functions for creating labeled values
('label'), using the values protected by 'Labeled' by unlabeling them
('unlabel'), and changing the value of a labeled value without
inspection ('relabelLabeledP', 'taintLabeled', 'untaintLabeled').  A
'Functor'-like class ('LabeledFunctor') on 'Labeled' is also defined
in this module.

{- $functor

Making 'Labeled' an instance of 'Functor' is problematic because:

1. 'fmap' would have type @Labeled l a -> (a -> b) -> Labeled b@ and thus 
    creating /new/ labeled values above the current clearance or below
    the current label would be feasible (given one such value).
2. 'LIO' is polymorphic in the label type and thus 'fmap' would is
   susceptible to /refinement attacks/. Superficially if the label type
   contains an integrity component (see for example "LIO.DCLabel")
   then @fmap (\ -> 3) lv@ would produce a high-integrity labeled @3@
   if @lv@ is a high-integrity labeled value without any any authority
   or /endorsement/.

As a result, we provide a class 'LabeledFunctor' that export 'lFmap'
(labeled 'lFmap') that addressed the above issues. Firstly, each newly
created value is in the 'LIO' monad and secondly each label format
implementation must produce their own definition of 'lFmap' such that
the end label protects the computation result accordingly.

-- | IFC-aware functor instance. Since certain label formats may contain
-- integrity information, this is provided as a class rather than a
-- function. Such label formats will likely wish to drop endorsements in
-- the new labeled valued.

  -- | 'fmap'-like funciton that is aware of the current label and
  -- clearance.

#ifdef TO_LABELED

{- $toLabeled

LIO provides a means for executing a sensitive computation without
raising the current label. This is done with the function 'toLabeled'.
The semantics of the function is as follows:

1. Execute whatever action is supplied. This action may raise the
current label or lower the current clearance.

2. Take the result of the computation and wrap it in a 'Labeled'
value. The label of the value is provided as an argument to
'toLabeled'. Hence, the computation should not observe anything more
sensitive than this.

3. Restore the current label and clearance to that of step 1. Return
the 'Labeled' value created in step 2, if the end current label is not
above the value's label. Otherwise raise an exception to indicate that
the computation read data more sensitive than the set bound.

Note that if the executed computation raises an exception, 'toLabeled'
hides the exception -- this exception is only propagated when the
'Labeled' value is 'unlabel'ed.

NOTE:
As indicated by the warnings, 'toLabeled' is not safe with respect to
/termination sensitive non-interference/. This means that a malicious
computation can carry out an attack that leaks information by not
terminating in a 'toLabeled' block. Similarly an attacker can leverage
timing to do the same.  Your version of LIO has been compiled with the
@toLabeled@ flag, and thus susceptible to such attacks. If this was
not by choice, recompile the package (by default, 'toLabeled' is not
included) and use the primitives in "LIO.Concurrent" to implement a
similarly-behaving program.

-}

-- | @toLabeled@ is the dual of 'unlabel'.  It allows one to invoke
-- computations that would raise the current label, but without
-- actually raising the label.  Instead, the result of the
-- computation is packaged into a 'Labeled' with a supplied
-- label. (Of couse, the computation executed by @toLabeled@ must
-- most observe any data whose label exceeds the supplied label.)
--
-- To get at the result of the computation one will have to call
-- 'unlabel' and raise the label, but this can be postponed, or
-- done inside some other call to 'toLabeled'.  This suggests that
-- the provided label must be above the current label and below
-- the current clearance.  --
-- Note that @toLabeled@ always restores the clearance to whatever
-- it was when it was invoked, regardless of what occurred in the
-- computation producing the value of the 'Labeled'.  This highlights
-- one main use of clearance: to ensure that a @Labeled@ computed
-- does not exceed a particular label.
--
-- If an exception is thrown within a @toLabeled@ block, such that
-- the outer context is withing a 'catch', which is further within
-- a @toLabeled@ block, infromation can be leaked. Consider the
-- following program that uses 'DCLabel's. (Note that 'discard' is
-- simply @toLabeled@ that throws throws the result away.)

--  >   lRef <- newLIORef bottom ""

--  >   forM_ ["fun", "secret"] $ \guess -> do
--  >     stash <- readLIORef lRef
--  >     writeLIORef lRef $ stash ++ "\n" ++ guess ++ ":"
--  >     discard top $ do
--  >       catch ( discard top $ do
--  >                 secret <- readLIORef hRef
--  >                 when (secret == guess) $ throwIO . userError $ "got it!"
--  >             ) (\(e :: IOError) -> return ())
--  >       l <- getLabel
--  >       when (l == bottom) $ do stash <- readLIORef lRef
--  >                             writeLIORef lRef $ stash ++ "no!"
--  >   readLIORef lRef
--  >     where evalDC' act = do (r,l) <- runDC act
--  >                            putStrLn r
--  >                            putStrLn $ "label = " ++ prettyShow l
--
--  The output of the program is:
--
--  > $ ./new
--  >
--  > fun:no!
--  > secret:
--  > label = <True , False>
--
-- Note that the current label is 'bottom' (which in DCLabels is
-- @<True , False>@), and the secret is leaked. The fundamental issue
-- is that the outer 'discard' allows for the current label to remain
-- low even though the 'catch' raised the current label when the
-- secret was found (and thus exception was throw). As a consequence,
-- 'toLabeled' catches all exceptions, and returns a 'Labeled'
-- value that may have a labeled exception as wrapped by @throw@.
-- All exceptions within the outer computation, including
-- IFC violation attempts, are essentially rethrown when performing
-- an 'unlabel'.
