This module implements labeled 'MVar's.  The interface is analogous to
"Control.Concurrent.MVar", but the operations take place in the 'LIO'
monad.  A labeled MVar, of type @'LMVar' l a@, is a mutable location
that can be in of of two states; an 'LMVar' can be empty, or it can be
full (with a value of type @a@). The location is protected by a label
of type 'l'.  As in the case of @LIORef@s (see "LIO.LIORef"), this
label is fixed and does not change according to the content placed
into the location.  Different from @LIORef@s, taking and putting
'LMVars' calls the write guard 'guardWrite' to enforce sound
information flow control.

'LMVar's can be used to build synchronization primitives and
communication channels ('LMVar's themselves are single-place
channels).  We refer to "Control.Concurrent.MVar" for the full
documentation on MVars.

-- Take 'LMVar'
--

-- | Return contents of the 'LMVar'. Note that a take consists of a read
-- and a write, since it observes whether or not the 'LMVar' is full, and
-- thus the current label must be the same as that of the 'LMVar' (of
-- course, this is not the case when using privileges).  Hence, if the
-- label of the 'LMVar' is below the current clearance, we raise the
-- current label to the join of the current label and the label of the
-- MVar and read the contents of the @MVar@. The underlying guard
-- 'guardWrite' will throw an exception if any of the IFC checks fail.
-- Finally, like 'MVars' if the 'LMVar' is empty, @takeLMVar@
-- blocks.
takeLMVar :: Label l => LMVar l a -> LIO l a

takeLMVarP :: PrivDesc l p => Priv p -> LMVar l a -> LIO l a
takeLMVarP = blessPTCB "takeLMVarP" takeMVar

-- | Non-blocking version of 'takeLMVar'. It returns @Nothing@ if the

-- 'LMVar'.
tryTakeLMVar :: Label l => LMVar l a -> LIO l (Maybe a)

-- Put 'LMVar'

-- | Puts a value into an 'LMVar'. Note that a put consists of a read and
-- a write, since it observes whether or not the 'LMVar' is empty, and so
-- the current label must be the same as that of the 'LMVar' (of course,
-- this is not the case when using privileges). As in the 'takeLMVar'
-- case, if the label of the 'LMVar' is below the current clearance, we
-- raise the current label to the join of the current label and the label
-- of the MVar and put the value into the @MVar@.  Moreover if these IFC
-- restrictions fail, the underlying 'guardWrite' throws an exception.
-- If the 'LMVar' is full, @putLMVar@ blocks.

--
-- Read 'LMVar'
--

-- | Combination of 'takeLMVar' and 'putLMVar'. Read the value, and
-- just put it back. This operation is not atomic, and can can result
-- in unexpected outcomes if another thread is simultaneously calling
-- a function such as 'putLMVar', 'tryTakeLMVarP', or 'isEmptyLMVar'
-- for this 'LMVar'.

readLMVarP = blessPTCB "readLMVarP" readMVar

--
-- Swap 'LMVar'
--

-- | Takes a value from an 'LMVar', puts a new value into the 'LMvar',
-- and returns the taken value.  Like the other 'LMVar' operations it is
-- required that the label of the 'LMVar' be above the current label and
-- below the current clearance. Moreover, the current label is raised to
-- accommodate for the observation. The underlying 'guardWrite' throws an
-- exception if this cannot be accomplished. This operation is atomic iff
-- there is no other thread calling 'putLMVar' for this 'LMVar'.

--
-- Check state of 'LMVar'
--

-- | Check the status of an 'LMVar', i.e., whether it is empty. The
-- function succeeds if the label of the 'LMVar' is below the current
-- clearance -- the current label is raised to the join of the 'LMVar'
-- label and the current label.
