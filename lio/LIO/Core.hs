This module implements the core of the Labeled IO (LIO) information
flow control (IFC) library.  It provides a monad, 'LIO', that is
intended to be used as a replacement for the 'IO' monad in untrusted
code.  The idea is for untrusted code to provide a computation in the
'LIO' monad, which trusted code can then safely execute through
'evalLIO' and similar functions (e.g., 'evalDC' in
"LIO.DCLabel#v:evalDC").

Unlike 'IO', the 'LIO' monad keeps track of a /current label/
(accessible via the 'getLabel' function) during each computation. The
current label effectively tracks the sensitivity of all the data that
the computation has observed.  For example, if the computation has
read a \"secret\" mutable reference (see "LIO.LIORef") and then the
result of a \"top-secret\" thread (see "LIO.Concurrent") then the
current label will be at least \"top-secret\".  Labels are described
in more detail in the documentation for "LIO.Label", as well as the
documentation for particular label formats (such as "LIO.DCLabel").

The role of the current label is two-fold:  First, the current label
protects all pure values currently in scope.  For example, the current
label is the label on constants (such as @3@ and @\"tis a string\"@)
as well as function arguments.  More interestingly, consider reading a
secret reference:

> val <- readLIORef secret

Though the label of @secret@ may be \"secret\", @val@ is not
explicitly labeled.  Hence, to protect the contents of the 'LIORef'
that has been read into @val@, the current label must be at least
\"secret\" before returning from @readLIORef@.  More generally, if the
current label is @l_cur@, then it is only permissible to read data
labeled @l_r@ if @l_r ``canFlowTo`` l_cur@.  Note that, instead of
throwing an exception, reading data often just increases the current
label to ensure that @l_r ``canFlowTo`` l_cur@.  This is acomplished
using a function such as 'taint'.

The second purpose of the current label is to prevent inforation leaks
into public channels. Specifically, it is only permissible to modify
or write to data labeled @l_w@ when @l_cur``canFlowTo`` l_w@. Thus,
the following attempt to leak the @val@ after reading it from a secret
'LIORef' would fail:

> writeLIORef public val

In addition to the current label, the LIO monad keeps a second label,
the /current clearance/ (accessible via the 'getClearance' function).
The clearance can be used to enforce a \"need-to-know\" policy, since
it represents the highest value the current label can be raised to.
In other words, if the current clearance is @l_clear@ then the
computation cannot create, read or write to objects labeled @l@ such
that @(l ``canFlowTo`` l_clear) == False@.

{- $guards

   Guards are used by (usually privileged) code to check that the
   invoking, unprivileged code has access to particular data.  If the
   current label is @lcurrent@ and the current clearance is
   @ccurrent@, then the following checks should be performed when
   accessing data labeled @ldata@:

   * When /reading/ an object labeled @ldata@, it must be the case
     that @ldata ``canFlowTo`` lcurrent@.  This check is performed by
     the 'taint' function, so named because it \"taints\" the current
     'LIO' context by raising @lcurrent@ until @ldata ``canFlowTo``
     lcurrent@.  Specifically, it does this by computing the least
     upper bound or 'lub' of the two labels.  (Note 'taint' will fail
     if the new label cannot flow to the current clearance.)

   * When /creating/ or /allocating/ objects, it is permissible for
     them to be higher than the current label, so long as they are
     below the current clearance.  In other words, it must be the
     case that @lcurrent ``canFlowTo`` ldata && ldata ``canFlowTo``
     ccurrent@.  This is ensured by the 'guardAlloc' function.

   * When /writing/ an object, it should be the case that
     @lcurrent ``canFlowTo`` ldata && ldata ``canFlowTo`` lcurrent@.
     (As stated, this is the same as saying @ldata == lcurrent@, but
     the two are different when using 'canFlowToP' instead of
     'canFlowTo'.) This is ensured by the 'guardWrite' function, which
     does the equivalent of 'taint' to ensure the target label @ldata@
     can flow to the current label, then throws an exception if
     @lcurrent@ cannot flow back to the target label.

Note that a write /always/ implies a read.  Hence, when writing to an
object for which you can observe the result (which is frequently the
case), you must use 'guardWrite'.  However, when performing a write
for which there are no observable side-effects to the writer, i.e.,
you cannot observe the success or failure of the write, then it is
safe to use 'guardAlloc'.

The 'taintP', 'guardAllocP',  and 'guardWriteP' functions are variants
of the above that take privilege to be more permissive and raise the
current label less.

-- | Use @taint l@ in trusted code before observing an object labeled
