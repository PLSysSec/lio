This module implements the core of the Labeled IO (LIO) library for
information flow control (IFC) in Haskell.  It provides a monad,
'LIO', that is intended to be used as a replacement for the 'IO' monad
in untrusted code.  The idea is for untrusted code to provide a
computation in the 'LIO' monad, which trusted code can then safely
execute through using 'evalLIO'-like functions. Though, usually a
wrapper function is employed depending on the type of /labels/ used by
an application.  For example, with "LIO.DCLabel" trusted code would
'evalDC' to execute an untrusted computation.

Labels are a way of describing who can observe and modify data. (A
detailed consideration of labels is given in "LIO.Label".) LIO
associates a /current label/ with every 'LIO' computation. The current
label effectively tracks the sensitivity of all the data that the
computation has observed.  For example, if the computation has read a
\"secret\" mutable refernce (see "LIO.LIORef") and then the result of
a \"top-secret\" thread (see "LIO.Concurrent") then the current label
will be at least \"top-secret\". The role of the current label is
two-fold. First, the current label protects all the data in scope --
it is the label associated with any /unlabeled/ data. For example, the
current label is the label on contants such as @3@ or @\"tis a
string\"@. More interestingly, consider reading a \"secret\" file:

> bs <- readFile "/secret/file.txt"

Though the label in the file store may be \"secret\", @bs@ has type
@ByteString@, which is not explicitly labeled. Hence, to protect the
contents (@bs@) the current label must be at least \"secret\" before
executing @readFile@.  More generally, if the current label is
@L_cur@, then it is only permissible to read data labeled @L_r@ if
@L_r ``canFlowTo`` L_cur@.  Note that, rather than throw an exception,
reading data will often just increase the current label to ensure that
@L_r ``canFlowTo`` L_cur@ using 'taint'.

Second, the current label prevents inforation leaks into public
channels. Specifically, it is only permissible to modify, or write
to, data labeled @L_w@ when @L_cur``canFlowTo`` L_w@. Thus, it the
following attempt to leak the secret @bs@ would fail:

> writeFile "/public/file.txt" bs

In addition to the current label, the LIO monad keeps a second label,
the current /clearance/ (accessible via the 'getClearance' function).
The clearance can be used to enforce a \"need-to-know\" policy since
it represents the highest value the current label can be raised to.
In other words, if the current clearance is @L_clear@ then the
computation cannot create, read or write to objects labeled @L@ such
that @L ``canFlowTo`` L_clear@ does not hold.

This module exports the 'LIO' monad, functions to access the internal
state (e.g., 'getLabel' and 'getClearance'), functions for raising and
catching exceptions, and IFC guards.  Exceptions are core to LIO since
they provide a way to deal with potentially-misbehaving untrusted
code. Specifically, when a computation is about to violate IFC (as
@writeFile@ above), an exception is raised. Guards provide a useful
abstraction for dealing with labeled objects; they should be used
before performing a read-only, write-only, or read-write operation on
a labeled object. The remaining core, but not all, abstractions are
exported by "LIO".

-- Exceptions
--

{- $exceptions

   We must define 'throwIO'- and 'catch'-like functions to work in
   the 'LIO' monad.  A complication is that exceptions could
   potentially leak information.  For instance, one might examine a
   secret bit, and throw an exception when the bit is 1 but not 0.
   Allowing untrusted code to catch the exception leaks the bit.

   The solution is to wrap exceptions up with a label.  The exception
   may be caught, but only if the label of the exception can flow to
   the label at the point the catch statement began execution.
   Arbitrary code can use 'throwLIO' to throw an exception that will
   be labeled with the current label, while 'catchLIO' can be used to
   catch exceptions (whose label flows to the current clearance).
   Wherever possible, code should use the 'catchLIOP' and
   'onExceptionP' variants that use privileges to downgrade the
   exception. 

   If an exception is uncaught in the 'LIO' monad, the 'evalLIO'
   function will re-throw the exception, so that it is okay to throw
   exceptions from within the 'LIO' monad and catch them within the
   'IO' monad.  Of course, code in the 'IO' monad must be careful not
   to let the 'LIO' code exploit it to exfiltrate information.  Hence,
   we recommend the use of 'paranoidLIO' to execute 'LIO' actions as
   to prevent accidental, but unwanted crashes.


   /Note/:  Do not use 'throw' (as opposed to 'throwLIO') within the
   'LIO' monad.  Because 'throw' can be invoked from pure code, it has
   no notion of current label and so cannot assign an appropriate
   label to the exception.  As a result, the exception will not be
   catchable within the 'LIO' monad and will propagate all the way out
   to the executing 'IO' layer.  Similarly, asynchronous exceptions
   (such as divide by zero or undefined values in lazily evaluated
   expressions) cannot be caught within the 'LIO' monad.

Similar to "Control.Exception" we export 'onException', 'finally' and
'bracket' which should be used by programmers to properly acquire and
release resources in the presence of exceptions.  Different from
"Control.Exception" our non-TCB utilities are not implemented in terms
of 'mask', and thus untrusted threads may be killed (and thus garbage
collected) with synchronous exceptions. Of course, only trusted code
may has access to 'throwTo'-like functionality.

-- Guards
--

{- $guards

   Guards are used by (usually privileged) code to check that the
   invoking, unprivileged code has access to particular data.  If the
   current label is @lcurrent@ and the current clearance is
   @ccurrent@, then the following checks should be performed when
   accessing data labeled @ldata@:

   * When /reading/ an object labeled @ldata@, it must be the case
     that @ldata ``canFlowTo`` lcurrent@.  This check is performed by
     the 'taint' function, so named because it \"taints\" the current
     'LIO' context by raising @lcurrent@ until @ldata ``canFlowTo``
     lcurrent@.  (Specifically, it does this by computing the
     least 'upperBound' of the two labels.) However, this is done
     only if the new @lcurrent ``canFlowTo`` ccurrent@.

   * When /creating/ or /allocating/ objects, it is permissible for
     them to be higher than the current label, so long as they are
     below the current clearance.  In other words, it must be the
     case that @lcurrent ``canFlowTo`` ldata && ldata ``canFlowTo``
     ccurrent@.  This is ensured by the 'guardAlloc' function.

   * When /writing/ an object, it should be the case that
     @lcurrent ``canFlowTo`` ldata && ldata ``canFlowTo`` lcurrent@.
     (As stated, this is the same as saying @ldata == lcurrent@, but
     the two are different when using 'canFlowToP' instead of
     'canFlowTo'.) This is ensured by the 'guardWrite' function, which
     does the equivalent of 'taint' to ensure the target label @ldata@
     can flow to the current label, then throws an exception if
     @lcurrent@ cannot flow back to the target label.

     Note that in this case a write /always/ implies a read. Hence,
     when writing to an object for which you can observe the result,
     you must use 'guardWrite'. However, when performing a write for
     which there is no observable side-effects to the writer, i.e.,
     you cannot observe the success or failure of the write, then it
     is safe to solely use 'guardAlloc'.


The 'taintP', 'guardAllocP',  and 'guardWriteP' functions are variants
of the above that take privilege to be more permissive and raise the
current label less.
