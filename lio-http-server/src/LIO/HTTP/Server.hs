This module exposes a general interface for writing web apps. It's
slightly simpler than Wai, but also more general in allowing code to run in
an arbitrary monad (vs. IO). For example, this module exports an HTTP server
implementation in lio's 'DC' monad. Here is a simple example using this directly:

@
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import LIO.HTTP.Server

main :: IO ()
main = server 3000 "127.0.0.1" app

app :: DCApplication
app _ = do
  return $ Response status200 [] "Hello World!"
@

The current 'Request' interface is deliberately simple in making all but the
request body pure. This may change since we may wish to label certain
headers (e.g., because they are sensitive) in the future and labeling a
whole request object may be too coarse grained.

Similarly, the 'Response' data type is deliberately simple. This may be
extended to make it easy to securely stream data in the future.
