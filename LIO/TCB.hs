-- | This module implements the core of the Labeled IO library for
-- information flow control in Haskell.  It provides a monad, 'LIO',
-- that is intended to be used as a replacement for the IO monad in
-- untrusted code.  The idea is for untrusted code to provide a
-- computation in the 'LIO' monad, which trusted code can then safely
-- execute through the 'evalLIO' function.  (Though usually a wrapper
-- function is employed depending on the type of labels used by an
-- application.  For example, with "LIO.DCLabel", you would use
-- 'evalDC' to execute an untrusted computation. There are also
-- abbreviations for the 'LIO' monad type of a particular
-- label--for instance 'DC'.)
--
-- A data structure 'Labeled' (labeled value) protects access to pure
-- values.  Without the appropriate privileges, one cannot produce a
-- pure value that depends on a secret 'Labeled', or conversely produce a
-- high-integrity 'Labeled' based on pure data. 
--
-- Similarly a data structure 'LabledThunk' (labeld thunk) protects
-- the result of a computation that possibly terminated with an
-- exception. Specifically, the function 'toLabeledThunk'
-- allows one to seal off the results of an LIO computation inside a
-- 'LabeledThunk' without tainting the current flow of execution. 
-- 'unlabel' conversely allows one to use the value stored within a
-- 'LabeledThunk'.
--
-- We note that using 'toLabeledThunk' is /not/ safe with respect to the
-- termination covert channel. Specifically, LIO with 'toLabeledThunk' is
-- only termination-insensitive non-interfering. For a
-- termination-sensitive 'toLabeledThunk'-like function, see
-- "LIO.Concurrent".
-- 
-- Any code that imports this module is part of the
-- /Trusted Computing Base/ (TCB) of the system.  Hence, untrusted
-- code must be prevented from importing this module.  The exported
-- symbols ending @...TCB@ can be used to violate label protections
-- even from within pure code or the LIO Monad.  A safe subset of
-- these symbols is exported by the "LIO.Safe" module, which is how
-- untrusted code should access the core label functionality.
-- ("LIO.Safe" is also re-exported by "LIO", the main gateway to
-- this library.)

{- $labels

Labels are a way of describing who can observe and modify data.  There
is a partial order, generally pronounced \"can flow to\" on labels.
In Haskell we write this partial order ``leq`` (in the literature it
is usually written as &#8849;).

The idea is that data labeled @L_1@ should affect data labeled
@L_2@ only if @L_1@ ``leq`` @L_2@, (i.e., @L_1@ /can flow to/
@L_2@).  The 'LIO' monad keeps track of the current label of the
executing code (accessible via the 'getLabel' function).  Code may
attempt to perform various IO or memory operations on labeled data.
Touching data may change the current label (or throw an exception
if an operation would violate can-flow-to restrictions).

If the current label is @L_cur@, then it is only permissible to
read data labeled @L_r@ if @L_r ``leq`` L_cur@.  This is sometimes
termed \"no read up\" in the literature; however, because the partial
order allows for incomparable labels (i.e., two labels @L_1@ and
@L_2@ such that @not (L_1 ``leq`` L_2) && not (L_2 ``leq`` L_1)@),
a more appropriate phrasing would be \"read only what can flow to
your label\".  Note that, rather than throw an exception, reading
data will often just increase the current label to ensure that
@L_r ``leq`` L_cur@.  The LIO monad keeps a second label, called
the /clearance/ (see 'getClearance'), that represents the highest
value the current thread can raise its label to. The purpose of
clearance is to enforce of discretionary access control: you can
set the clearance to a label @L_clear@ as to prevent a piece of
LIO code from reading anything above @L_clear@.

Conversely, it is only permissible to modify data labeled @L_w@
when @L_cur``leq`` L_w@, a property often cited as \"no write
down\", but more accurately characterized as \"write only what you
can flow to\".  In practice, there are very few IO abstractions
(namely, mutable references) in which it is possible to do a pure
write that doesn't also involve observing some state.  For instance,
writing to a file handle and not getting an exception tells you that
the handle is not closed.  Thus, in practice, the requirement for
modifying data labeled @L_w@ is almost always that @L_cur == L_w@.

Note that higher labels are neither more nor less privileged than
lower ones.  Simply, the higher one's label is, the more things one
can read.  Conversely, the lower one's label, the more things one can
write.  But, because labels are a partial and not a total order, 
some data may be completely inaccessible to a particular computation;
for instance, if the current label is @L_cur@, the current clearance
  is @C_cur@, and some data is labeled @Ld_@, such that @not (L_cur
``leq`` L_d || L_d ``leq`` C_cur)@, then the current thread can
neither read nor write the data, at least without invoking some
privilege.

{- | This class defines a label format, corresponding to a bounded
lattice. Specifically, it is necessary to define a bottom element
'lbot' (in literature, written as &#8869;), a top element 'ltop'
(in literature, written as &#8868;), a join, or least upper bound,
'lub' (in literature, written as &#8852;), a meet, or greatest lower
bound, 'glb' (in literature, written as &#8851;), and of course the
can-flow-to partial-order 'leq' (in literature, written as &#8849;).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Basic privilege functions ----------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

{- $privs

Privilege comes from a separate class called 'Priv', representing the
ability to bypass the protection of certain labels.  Essentially,
privilege allows you to behave as if @L_1 ``leq`` L_2@ even when
that is not the case.  The process of making data labeled @L_1@
affect data labeled @L_2@ when @not (L_1 ``leq`` L_2)@ is called
/downgrading/.

The basic method of the 'Priv' object is 'leqp', which performs the
more permissive can-flow-to check in the presence of particular
privileges (in literature this relation is a pre-order, commonly
written as &#8849;&#8346;).  Many 'LIO' operations have variants
ending @...P@ that take a privilege argument to act in a more
permissive way.  It is also possible to execute an 'LIO' action with
a set of privileges (without explicitly using the @...P@ combinators)
using the 'withPrivileges' combinator.  Practicing the /principle of
least privilege/, it is recommended that 'withPrivileges' only be
used in small blocks of code in which many operations require the
same privileges. It is safer to use @...P@ operators and privileges
explicitly.

All 'Priv' types are monoids, and so can be combined with 'mappend'.
How to create 'Priv' objects is specific to the particular label
type in use.  The method used is 'mintTCB', but the arguments depend
on the particular label type.  (Of course, the symbol 'mintTCB'
must not be available to untrusted code.)

-- LIO guards -------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

{- $guards

   Guards are used by privileged code to check that the invoking,
   unprivileged code has access to particular data.  If the current
   label is @lcurrent@ and the current clearance is @ccurrent@, then
   the following checks should be performed when accessing data
   labeled @ldata@:

   * When /reading/ an object labeled @ldata@, it must be the case
     that @ldata ``leq`` lcurrent@.  This check is performed by the
     'taint' function, so named becuase it \"taints\" the current LIO
     context by raising @lcurrent@ until @ldata ``leq`` lcurrent@.
     (Specifically, it does this by computing the least upper bound of
     the two labels with the 'lub' method of the 'Label' class.)
     However, if after doing this it would be the case that
     @not (lcurrent ``leq`` ccurrent)@, then 'taint' throws exception
     'LerrClearance' rather than raising the current label.

   * When /writing/ an object, it should be the case that @ldata
     ``leq`` lcurrent && lcurrent ``leq`` ldata@.  (As stated, this is
     the same as saying @ldata == lcurrent@, but the two are different
     when using 'leqp' instead of 'leq'.)  This is ensured by the
     'wguard' (write guard) function, which does the equivalent of
     'taint' to ensure the target label @ldata@ can flow to the
     current label, then throws an exception if @lcurrent@ cannot flow
     back to the target label.

   * When /creating/ or /allocating/ objects, it is permissible for
     them to be higher than the current label, so long as they are
     bellow the current clearance.  In other words, it must be the
     case that @lcurrent ``leq`` ldata && ldata ``leq`` ccurrent@.
     This is ensured by the 'aguard' (allocation guard) function.

The 'taintP', 'wguardP',  and 'aguardP' functions are variants of the
above that take privilege to be more permissive and raise the current
label less.

-- Labeled Exceptions -----------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

{- $lexception

LIO throws 'LabelFault' exceptions when an information flow violation
is to occur. In general, such exceptions are handled in the outer,
trusted IO code block that executes untrusted LIO code. However, it is
sometimes desirable for untrusted code to throw exceptions. To this
end we provide an implementation of labeled exceptions, as \"normal\"
exceptions are unsafe and can be used to leak information.  We
describe the interface below.

-}

-- takes a string parameter -- it is important that trusted code use
-- this carefully and aovid leaking information through it.

instance Exception LabelFault


{- $throw

   We must re-define the 'throwIO' and 'catch' functions to work in
   the 'LIO' monad.  A complication is that exceptions could
   potentially leak information.  For instance, within a block of code
   wrapped by 'discard', one might examine a secret bit, and throw an
   exception when the bit is 1 but not 0.  Allowing untrusted code to
   catch the exception leaks the bit.

   The solution is to wrap exceptions up with a label.  The exception
   may be caught, but only if the label of the exception can flow to
   the label at the point the catch statement began execution.  For
   compatibility, the 'throwIO', 'catch', and 'onException' functions
   are now methods that work in both the 'IO' or 'LIO' monad.

   If an exception is uncaught in the 'LIO' monad, the 'evalLIO'
   function will unlabel and re-throw the exception, so that it is
   okay to throw exceptions from within the 'LIO' monad and catch them
   within the 'IO' monad.  (Of course, code in the 'IO' monad must be
   careful not to let the 'LIO' code exploit it to exfiltrate
   information.)

   Wherever possible, however, code should use the 'catchP' and
   'onExceptionP' variants that use whatever privilege is available to
   downgrade the exception.  Privileged code that must always run some
   cleanup function can use the 'onExceptionTCB' and 'bracketTCB'
   functions to run the cleanup code on all exceptions.

   /Note/:  Do not use 'throw' (as opposed to 'throwIO') within the
   'LIO' monad.  Because 'throw' can be invoked from pure code, it has
   no notion of current label and so cannot assign an appropriate
   label to the exception.  As a result, the exception will not be
   catchable within the 'LIO' monad and will propagate all the way out
   of the 'evalLIO' function.  Similarly, asynchronous exceptions
   (such as divide by zero or undefined values in lazily evaluated
   expressions) cannot be caught within the 'LIO' monad.
