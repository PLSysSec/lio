About
=============

The *Labeled IO* (LIO) library is an information flow control (IFC)
library. IFC is a mechanism that enforces security policies by
tracking and controlling the flow of information within a system.
Different from discretionary access control (think UNIX file
permissions), with IFC you can execute an untrusted computation on
your secret data and be sure that it does not leak it or overwrite
it.

LIO is an IFC library that can be used to implement such untrusted
computations. LIO provides combinators similar to those of 'IO' for
performing side-effecting computations (e.g., accessing the
filesystem, modifying mutable references, throwing exceptions, etc.)
To track and control the flow of information, LIO associates a
security policy, usually called a *label*, with every piece of data.
A label may, for example, impose a restriction on who can observe,
propagate, or modify the data labeled as such.  Different from
standard IO operations, the LIO counterparts usually take an
additional parameter for the label which they inspect before
actually performing the (underlying IO) side-effecting computation.
So, before writing to a file LIO asserts that the write will not
violate any security policies associated with the file or the data
to be written.

Most code should import module `LIO` and whichever label format the
application is using (e.g., `LIO.DCLabel`). All untrusted code
should have type `LIO`, which trusted code can safely execute with
`evalLIO`. See [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lio) for a
description of the core library API.

formal modeling/proofs, are available here:

Structure of repository
=============

This repository is divided into three packages:

- `lio`: The main LIO library

- `lio-fs`: Simple IFC filesystem library

- `quickcheck-lio-instances`: QuickCheck2 instances for LIO

- `lio-eval`: Tests and benchmarks. This is a package solely because it
  depends on both `lio` and `quickcheck-lio-instances`. Having the
  tests and benchmarks in `lio` leads to a circular dependency.

- `lio-http-server`: Simple HTTP server implementation. Forked into its own
  project [Frankie](https://github.com/plsyssec/frankie/).

- `lio-simple`: Slightly older simple HTTP server implementation atop
  [Simple](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/simple).
